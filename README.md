<summary>2️ What is HTTP?</summary>

**HTTP** → **HyperText Transfer Protocol**  
It’s a way for the client (your browser) and the server (where a website lives) to talk to each other over the internet.

<summary>3 What is DNS?</summary>

**DNS** → **Domain Name System**  
The internet’s phonebook. It translates human-friendly website names (like `google.com`) into machine-friendly IP addresses (like `142.250.190.78`).  

**Analogy:**  
Think of it like a game username + tag combo:  
- **Username** → what other players see  
- **Tag** → the unique ID just for you
